# Sonar Data Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that uses Logistic Regression to classify sonar signals as either a "Mine" (M) or a "Rock" (R). The project is implemented in Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning operations and Pandas for data manipulation.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between underwater objects (mines and rocks) based on sonar signal data. Logistic Regression is chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.

## Concepts Used

### 1. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a widely used classification algorithm suitable for binary and multi-class classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. In this project, Logistic Regression is employed to predict whether an object is a "Mine" or a "Rock" based on the features extracted from sonar signals.

### 2. Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and exploration. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles, are computed to gain insights into the distribution of features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are used to understand the characteristics of the dataset.

### 3. Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. The splitting is stratified to ensure that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets is representative of the overall dataset. This helps prevent bias in the model.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

A Logistic Regression model is trained using the training set. The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and testing sets using accuracy as the metric. Accuracy is a measure of the model's ability to correctly classify instances, which is appropriate for balanced datasets.

### 5. Making Predictions

The trained model is used to make predictions on new data points. An example input is provided, and the model predicts whether the object is a "Mine" or a "Rock."

## How to Use

1. **Open in Colab**: Click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the notebook to run the code in a Google Colab environment.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure that the required dependencies (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn) are installed. You can install them using the following commands:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```

3. **Exploration**: Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to better understand the characteristics of the data.

4. **Model Training**: Train the Logistic Regression model using the provided code. Evaluate the model's accuracy on both the training and testing sets.

5. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points. An example input is provided in the code.

## Results and Improvements

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 83.42% on the training data and 76.19% on the test data. To further enhance performance, consider experimenting with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring more advanced classification algorithms.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and improve the model's accuracy.
Will be eagerly waiting for your valuble PR's.
